# Housing Management System - Frontend Integration Requirements

## Overview

This document outlines how the various components of the Housing Management System should be integrated in the frontend to create a cohesive and user-friendly application. The system consists of the following core modules:

1. **User Management System** - Handles different user types and their permissions
2. **Property Management System** - Manages various property types and their availability
3. **Lease Management System** - Manages lease agreements between tenants and properties
4. **Maintenance Request System** - Handles maintenance requests and their lifecycle

## Integration Principles

### 1. Unified Navigation

The frontend should provide a consistent navigation structure that:

- Adapts to the user's role
- Provides quick access to role-specific features
- Maintains consistent positioning across all modules
- Includes global search functionality
- Shows appropriate notifications

### 2. Shared Components

Develop and utilize shared UI components:

- User selection components
- Property selection components
- Date range pickers
- Status indicators
- Filter components
- Form elements
- Table/list views
- Action buttons

### 3. Cross-Module Workflows

The following workflows span multiple modules and require special integration attention:

#### Housing Assignment Workflow

```text
User Management → Property Management → Lease Management
```

- User profile information flows into lease creation
- Property availability is updated when leases are created
- User dashboard reflects assigned housing

#### Maintenance Request Workflow

```text
User Management → Lease Management → Maintenance Requests → User Management
```

- User submits request related to their leased property
- Maintenance staff receives and processes the request
- Payment is processed
- Status updates are reflected in user and staff dashboards

#### Property Status Management Workflow

```text
Property Management → Lease Management → Maintenance Requests
```

- Property status affects its availability for leasing
- Maintenance requests can change property status
- Lease termination updates property status

### 4. Data Consistency

Ensure data consistency across modules:

- User information should be consistent across all views
- Property details should match in all modules
- Lease information should be synchronized with property and user data
- Status changes in one module should reflect in related modules

## User Interface Integration

### 1. Dashboard Integration

Create role-based dashboards that integrate relevant information from all modules:

#### For Students/Teachers

- Active lease information (from Lease Management)
- Property details (from Property Management)
- Maintenance request status (from Maintenance Request System)
- Profile completeness (from User Management)

#### For Housing Management

- Property occupancy metrics (from Property and Lease Management)
- Pending lease approvals (from Lease Management)
- Maintenance request statistics (from Maintenance Request System)
- User statistics (from User Management)

#### For Maintenance Staff

- Assigned maintenance tasks (from Maintenance Request System)
- Property information for tasks (from Property Management)
- Tenant contact information (from User Management)

### 2. Notification System

Implement a centralized notification system that:

- Alerts users about lease expirations (from Lease Management)
- Notifies about maintenance request updates (from Maintenance Request System)
- Informs about property status changes (from Property Management)
- Delivers administrative messages (from User Management)

### 3. Search Integration

Provide a global search that can:

- Find users across all user types
- Locate properties regardless of type
- Retrieve lease information
- Access maintenance requests
- Present results in a unified, categorized format

## API Integration Strategy

### 1. Authentication and Authorization

```http
POST /api/auth/login
POST /api/auth/logout
GET /api/auth/me
```

- Implement token-based authentication
- Store authentication state in a centralized store
- Apply role-based access control to UI elements
- Include authentication tokens in all API requests

### 2. API Organization

Use consistent API patterns across modules:

- RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations
- Consistent response formats
- Standardized error handling
- Proper pagination and filtering parameters

### 3. Real-time Updates

Implement WebSocket connections for real-time updates:

```text
ws://api/notifications
ws://api/maintenance-status
```

- Update maintenance request status in real-time
- Refresh property availability without page reload
- Show lease approval notifications immediately

## Technical Integration Requirements

### 1. State Management

- Implement a centralized state management solution
- Share relevant state between modules
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Implement optimistic UI updates

### 2. Routing Strategy

- Create a hierarchical routing structure
- Support deep linking to specific items in any module
- Preserve filter and search parameters in URLs
- Handle route transitions smoothly

### 3. Error Handling

- Develop a consistent error handling strategy
- Display user-friendly error messages
- Log errors for troubleshooting
- Recover gracefully from API failures

### 4. Performance Considerations

- Lazy load module components
- Implement pagination for large data sets
- Optimize API requests with filtering and selection
- Cache static data where appropriate

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Integration

- Implement unified navigation
- Create shared components library
- Set up authentication and authorization
- Develop basic dashboard integrations

### Phase 2: Workflow Integration

- Implement cross-module workflows
- Develop notification system
- Create global search functionality
- Add real-time updates

### Phase 3: Advanced Integration

- Implement advanced analytics across modules
- Add reporting features using cross-module data
- Develop admin tools for system management
- Optimize performance and user experience

## Testing Integration Points

1. User authentication flows across all modules
2. Data consistency between related entities
3. Status propagation between modules
4. Performance with realistic data loads
5. Permission enforcement across module boundaries
6. Error handling across module interactions
7. Real-time update reliability
